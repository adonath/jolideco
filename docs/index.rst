Jolideco Documentation
**********************

This is the documentation for Jolideco. Jolideco is a Python library for Joint
Likelihood deconvolution of a set of observations in the presence of Poisson noise.
I improves both the spatial resolution of the observations and signal to noise ratio.

"Jolideco" is short for "(Jo)int (Li)kelihood (De)convolution" and means
"pretty decoration" in French. 

Jolideco relies on `Pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.

.. warning::

    Jolideco is still in development!
